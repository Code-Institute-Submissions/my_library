      <h2>Genre</h2>
      <p>As you can see, a large part of my personal library consists of fantasy stories, but there are other genres present.</p>
      <div id="genres"></div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Authors</h2>
      <p>Not much explanation here, this just shows the balance of books by author. I have some clearly defined favourites, obviously!</p>
      <div id="authors"></div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Series vs Stand-Alone</h2>
      <p>To avoid skewing due to long series, a series gets counted only once, by selecting the first one in the series. This will be a bar chart.</p>
      <div id="seriesOrNot"></div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Protagonist's Gender</h2>
      <p>A word of explanation about the Gender chart:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Male is a male protagonist and Female is a female main character, that much is obvious.</li>
        <li>Multiple stands for multiple main characters of different genders. This applies when the story is told from multiple
          characters' point of view or the book is a collections of short stories.</li>
        <li>None is a book without a protagonist, such as an encyclopedia, a historical account or other educational materials.</li>
      </ul>
      <div id="protGender"></div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Languages</h2>
      <p>As a native speaker of Dutch, of course my library has a number of books in that language.</p>
      <p>However, my prefered language for reading in recent years has been English. Let's find out how those balance out, shall we?</p>
