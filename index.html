          <h2>Genre</h2>
          <p>As you can see, a large part of my personal library consists of fantasy stories, but there are other genres present.</p>
          <div id="genres"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <h2>Authors</h2>
          <p>Not much explanation here, this just shows the balance of books by author. I have some clearly defined favourites,
            obviously!
          </p>

          <h2>Series vs Stand-Alone</h2>
          <p>To avoid skewing due to long series, a series gets counted only once, by selecting the first one in the series.
            This will be a bar chart.</p>
          (note to self: count 0 and 1 ONLY)
          <div id="seriesOrNot"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <h2>Protagonist's Gender</h2>
          <p>A word of explanation about the Gender chart:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> Male is a male protagonist.</li>
            <li>Female is a female main character.</li>
            <li>Multiple stands for multiple main characters of different genders. This applies when the story is told from multiple
              characters' point of view or the book is a collection of short stories.</li>
            <li>None is a book without a protagonist, such as an encyclopedia, a historical account or other educational materials.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note: When applicable, trans and gender-fluid protagonists will also be added here, but I don't currently have
            books with either in my library.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <h2>Languages</h2>
          <p>As a native speaker of Dutch, of course my library has a number of books in that language.</p>
          <p>However, my prefered language for reading in recent years has been English. Let's find out how those balance out,
            shall we?
